### Worklog - 30.10.25

**What we did**
- Fixed unresolved import in `synth_integration.py` by setting `sys.path` to `synth-subnet` and using direct imports.
- Verified live deployment via PM2: running `/root/synth-subnet/neurons/miner.py` with CWD `/root/synth-subnet`.
- Confirmed live miner delegates to `synth_integration.generate_synth_simulations` from `synth/miner/simulations.py` and uses `get_all_volatilities` (volatility-aware Ensemble).
- Added `docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` documenting current setup, verification steps, safe updates, and rollback.
- Tidied repo: added `.gitignore` (caches, venvs, executables). Provided commands to remove unused `custom_synth_miner.py` and `rustup-init.exe`.

**Why it matters**
- Ensures deployment correctness and that recent volatility calculations are in effect.
- Establishes a repeatable verification/update path and cleaner repo hygiene, reducing drift and errors.

**Next steps (improving deployed miner performance)**
- Model/params
  - Tune volatility window and drift estimation in `models/baseline/volatility_calculator.py` (e.g., compare 1d/2d/3d windows).
  - Rebalance ensemble weights in `EnsembleGBMWeightedModel` and assess CRPS impact.
  - Add simple regime detection to switch weight profiles (trending vs mean-reverting periods).
- Observability
  - Log calibration values (drift/vol) per asset periodically for auditability.
  - Add lightweight CRPS sampling offline using recent responses to quantify improvements.
- Reliability
  - Cache Pyth price with backoff to avoid transient failures; add graceful fallback with last-known-good price.
  - Guardrails for outliers (clip/robust stats) before aggregation.
- Deployment workflow
  - Create a small benchmarking script to compare CRPS before/after changes on a fixed slice, commit results.
  - Roll out changes incrementally: update `synth-analogue-experiments`, restart PM2, monitor logs/metrics.

**Actionable checklist for tomorrow**
- Implement configurable volatility window + quick A/B test harness.
- Emit calibration telemetry (drift/vol) to logs at calibration time.
- Add basic outlier handling to ensemble aggregation.
- Prepare a short benchmark notebook/script and record baseline CRPS.
