## üîç **Detailed Issues Analysis**

### **Ensemble Model Problems**
- **Issue**: Ensemble models generate 24 time points, baseline models generate 25
- **Root Cause**: Ensemble model implementation doesn't include start time in predictions
- **Impact**: Cannot evaluate ensemble models with CRPS (length mismatch error)
- **Solution**: Fix ensemble model to match baseline model behavior

### **Notebook Structure Issues**
- **Issue**: Excessive debugging sections (cells 10-18) make notebook hard to follow
- **Root Cause**: Iterative debugging approach left redundant code
- **Impact**: Poor readability and maintainability
- **Solution**: Clean up structure, remove redundant debugging, create focused sections

### **Model Performance Insights**
- **Current Ranking** (from previous work):
  1. Mean Reversion: CRPS 757.07 (Best)
  2. Fluid Dynamics: CRPS 885.07
  3. Random Walk: CRPS 927.30
  4. GBM: CRPS 1028.66 (Worst)
- **Ensemble models**: Cannot be evaluated due to length mismatch
