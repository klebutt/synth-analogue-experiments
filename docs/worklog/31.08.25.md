# Next Steps - Synth Analog Experiments

## üéØ **Today's Work Plan - Priority Order**

### **1. Complete Baseline Model Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [x] Implement the TODO tests in `tests/test_baseline_models.py`
- [x] Test actual model predictions, not just placeholders
- [x] Verify CRPS calculation and performance metrics
- [x] Ensure all baseline models (RandomWalk, GBM, MeanReversion) work correctly

### **2. Implement CRPS Scoring (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [x] Create `models/crps.py` for Continuous Ranked Probability Score
- [x] Essential for Synth subnet performance evaluation
- [x] Integrate with existing test framework
- [x] Test CRPS calculation accuracy

### **3. Develop Working Notebooks (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Complete `notebooks/01_getting_started.ipynb`
- [ ] Complete `notebooks/02_model_development.ipynb`
- [ ] Add model comparison and visualization
- [ ] Create experiment tracking and results display

### **4. Enhance Analog Model (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Replace placeholder in `models/analog/fluid_dynamics.py`
- [ ] Implement actual fluid dynamics equations
- [ ] Add more analog-inspired approaches (reservoir computing, etc.)
- [ ] Test analog model performance against baselines

### **5. Synth Testnet Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Test with actual Synth subnet connection
- [ ] Validate miner interface compatibility
- [ ] Measure real-world performance and rewards
- [ ] Ensure compliance with Synth subnet requirements

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Items (Start Here)**

1. **‚úÖ Run the test suite** to see current failures - **COMPLETED**
2. **‚úÖ Implement CRPS calculation** - critical for Synth performance - **COMPLETED**
3. **‚úÖ Complete baseline model tests** to ensure reliability - **COMPLETED**
4. **Test with Synth testnet** to validate real-world functionality

## üìä **Current Status Summary**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Project structure and configuration
- Baseline model implementations (RandomWalk, GBM, MeanReversion)
- Comprehensive test framework setup
- Documentation and research notes
- **NEW: All baseline model tests passing (6/6)**
- **NEW: CRPS calculation implementation with comprehensive tests (10/10)**

### üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- Notebook development

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Synth testnet integration
- Performance benchmarking
- Model comparison analysis

## üéØ **Success Criteria for Today**

- [x] All baseline model tests pass
- [x] CRPS calculation working and tested
- [ ] At least one notebook functional
- [ ] Ready for Synth testnet testing

## üìù **Today's Progress Log**

### **Session 1: Baseline Model Testing (COMPLETED)**
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **What we accomplished**:
  - Implemented comprehensive tests for all 3 baseline models
  - Tests now validate: functionality, output format, parameter handling, performance
  - All 6 tests passing with real model validation
  - Reduced test time horizon from 24 hours to 1 hour for faster testing
  - Added proper error handling for edge cases

- **Key insights**:
  - Models are working correctly but don't validate negative time increments
  - Performance is good (tests complete in ~55 seconds including 1M simulation test)
  - Output format matches Synth subnet requirements
  - Models handle edge cases gracefully

### **Session 2: CRPS Implementation (COMPLETED)**
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **What we accomplished**:
  - Created comprehensive CRPS calculation module (`models/crps.py`)
  - Implemented CRPS formula: E|X - x| - 0.5 * E|X - X'|
  - Added Synth-specific formatting and model comparison
  - Created comprehensive test suite (10/10 tests passing)
  - Added convenience functions for easy integration

- **Key insights**:
  - CRPS calculation is working correctly with proper mathematical properties
  - Performance is good (handles 100 simulations √ó 50 time points in <10 seconds)
  - Ready for integration with Synth subnet evaluation
  - All 16 total tests now passing (baseline + CRPS)

- **Next priority**: Develop working notebooks for experimentation and visualization
