# Next Steps - Synth Analog Experiments

## üéØ **Today's Work Plan - Priority Order**

### **1. Complete Baseline Model Testing (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Implement the TODO tests in `tests/test_baseline_models.py`
- [ ] Test actual model predictions, not just placeholders
- [ ] Verify CRPS calculation and performance metrics
- [ ] Ensure all baseline models (RandomWalk, GBM, MeanReversion) work correctly

### **2. Implement CRPS Scoring (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Create `models/crps.py` for Continuous Ranked Probability Score
- [ ] Essential for Synth subnet performance evaluation
- [ ] Integrate with existing test framework
- [ ] Test CRPS calculation accuracy

### **3. Develop Working Notebooks (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Complete `notebooks/01_getting_started.ipynb`
- [ ] Complete `notebooks/02_model_development.ipynb`
- [ ] Add model comparison and visualization
- [ ] Create experiment tracking and results display

### **4. Enhance Analog Model (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Replace placeholder in `models/analog/fluid_dynamics.py`
- [ ] Implement actual fluid dynamics equations
- [ ] Add more analog-inspired approaches (reservoir computing, etc.)
- [ ] Test analog model performance against baselines

### **5. Synth Testnet Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] Test with actual Synth subnet connection
- [ ] Validate miner interface compatibility
- [ ] Measure real-world performance and rewards
- [ ] Ensure compliance with Synth subnet requirements

## üöÄ **Immediate Action Items (Start Here)**

1. **Run the test suite** to see current failures
2. **Implement CRPS calculation** - critical for Synth performance
3. **Complete baseline model tests** to ensure reliability
4. **Test with Synth testnet** to validate real-world functionality

## üìä **Current Status Summary**

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Project structure and configuration
- Baseline model implementations (RandomWalk, GBM, MeanReversion)
- Comprehensive test framework setup
- Documentation and research notes

### üîÑ **IN PROGRESS**
- Model testing and validation
- CRPS scoring implementation
- Notebook development

### ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- Synth testnet integration
- Performance benchmarking
- Model comparison analysis
- CRPS calculation

## üéØ **Success Criteria for Today**

- [ ] All baseline model tests pass
- [ ] CRPS calculation working and tested
- [ ] At least one notebook functional
- [ ] Ready for Synth testnet testing
