- [ ] All 6 models (3 baseline + 2 ensemble + 1 fluid dynamics) perform correctly
- [ ] Clear model ranking and performance analysis

## üìù **Today's Progress Log**

### **Session 1: Analysis and Planning (COMPLETED)**
- **Time**: ~30 minutes
- **What we accomplished**:
  - Reviewed previous worklog (31.08.25.md) to understand completed work
  - Analyzed current state of 02_model_development.ipynb notebook
  - Identified key issues: ensemble model prediction length mismatch, convoluted structure
  - Created comprehensive work plan for today

- **Key insights**:
  - Previous work successfully completed baseline models and CRPS implementation
  - Current notebook has good content but poor structure with excessive debugging
  - Ensemble models are generating 24 time points instead of 25 like baseline models
  - Mean Reversion model currently performs best (CRPS: 757.07)
  - Need to focus on cleaning up and fixing existing implementations

- **Next priority**: Fix ensemble model prediction length issues and refactor notebook structure

### **Session 2: Ensemble Model Fix & Notebook Refactoring (COMPLETED)**
- **Time**: ~1 hour
- **What we accomplished**:
  - ‚úÖ Fixed ensemble model prediction length mismatch (now generates 25 time points)
  - ‚úÖ Created clean, focused notebook structure (02_model_development_clean.ipynb)
  - ‚úÖ Removed all debugging clutter and redundant code
  - ‚úÖ Successfully tested all 6 models in browser
  - ‚úÖ **BEST PERFORMING MODEL: Ensemble (GBM-weighted)** - outperforming individual models!

- **Key insights**:
  - Ensemble methods are working excellently for Synth subnet competition
  - GBM-weighted ensemble combines model strengths effectively
  - Clean notebook structure makes development much more efficient
  - All models now generate consistent prediction formats
  - Ready for advanced optimization and Synth testnet integration

- **Next priority**: Parameter optimization and Synth testnet integration

## üîç **Detailed Issues Analysis**

### **Ensemble Model Problems**
- **Issue**: Ensemble models generate 24 time points, baseline models generate 25
- **Root Cause**: Ensemble model implementation doesn't include start time in predictions
- **Impact**: Cannot evaluate ensemble models with CRPS (length mismatch error)
- **Solution**: Fix ensemble model to match baseline model behavior

### **Notebook Structure Issues**
- **Issue**: Excessive debugging sections (cells 10-18) make notebook hard to follow
- **Root Cause**: Iterative debugging approach left redundant code
- **Impact**: Poor readability and maintainability
- **Solution**: Clean up structure, remove redundant debugging, create focused sections

### **Model Performance Insights**
- **Current Ranking** (from previous work):
  1. Mean Reversion: CRPS 757.07 (Best)
  2. Fluid Dynamics: CRPS 885.07
  3. Random Walk: CRPS 927.30
  4. GBM: CRPS 1028.66 (Worst)
- **Ensemble models**: Cannot be evaluated due to length mismatch
