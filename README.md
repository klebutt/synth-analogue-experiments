# Synth Analog Experiments

## Project Overview
This repo is a workspace for developing and testing **analog-inspired AI modules** for [Bittensor’s Synth subnet](https://github.com/opentensor/synth).  
The goal is to ground early technical progress in our long-term vision of **Analog-Inspired AGI**, while also generating income and traction by contributing useful forecasting modules to Synth.

## Why This Project?
- **Long-term vision**: We believe AGI requires more than current machine learning and LLM approaches. Specifically, it needs:
  - Abductive reasoning (Peirce’s logic of discovery).  
  - Handling continuous, time-based data streams.  
  - Parallelism and efficiency (analog-like computation).  
  - Continuous learning and self-organization.  
  - The ability to integrate values and meaning.  
- **Practical short-term**: Synth provides a feasible first testbed. Contributing forecasting models can both:
  - Demonstrate analog-inspired techniques in a live environment.  
  - Generate TAO (Bittensor’s token), funding ongoing development.  

This repo bridges vision and practice.

## Stage 2a: First Subnet Engagement (Synth)

### Overarching Objectives
1. **Develop analog-inspired forecasting modules** that can outperform baselines on Synth.  
2. **Validate these methods** in a real subnet environment.  
3. **Earn TAO rewards** to sustain and scale the project.  

### Technical Roadmap (Steps 1–3)

**Step 1: Environment Setup**
- Clone the Synth repo and get a test miner running locally.  
- Ensure local environment can ingest time-series data and submit forecasts.  

**Output:** Working local miner connected to Synth test network.

**Step 2: Baseline Forecasting**
- Implement simple models (e.g., moving average, ARIMA, basic MLP) to establish benchmarks.  
- Document performance and limitations.  

**Output:** Baseline forecast results + comparison notebook.  

---

**Step 3: Analog-Inspired Forecasting Module**
- Prototype analog-inspired approaches:  
  - Continuous-time dynamics (ODE-based models).  
  - Reservoir computing / echo state networks.  
  - Abductive signal interpretation (simple rule-driven anomaly detection + hypothesis generation).  
- Integrate module into Synth miner interface.  
- Compare with baselines.  

**Output:**  
- Analog-inspired model integrated with Synth miner.  
- Experiment results (performance + reward data).
