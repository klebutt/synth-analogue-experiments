## 🚀 **Deployment Options**

### Option 1: Direct Integration (Recommended)
Replace the Synth subnet's `simulations.py` with our implementation:

```python
# In synth-subnet/synth/miner/simulations.py
from synth_integration import generate_synth_simulations

# The function signature is identical to the original
# Just replace the implementation
```

### Option 2: Custom Miner Deployment
Use our `deployment_miner.py` as a standalone miner:

```bash
# Run our production miner
python deployment_miner.py
```

### Option 3: Full Synth Subnet Deployment
Follow the official Synth subnet deployment guide with our integrated model.

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'synth'"
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and have installed dependencies

**Issue**: Validation returns "INCORRECT"
**Solution**: Check that our model generates exactly 289 time points (24 hours with 5-minute increments)

**Issue**: Slow processing times
**Solution**: Reduce num_simulations from 100 to 50 for faster processing

**Issue**: Price fetching fails
**Solution**: Check internet connection and Pyth network availability
