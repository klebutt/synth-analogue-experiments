# Worklog - October 11, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Achievements

### âœ… **Miner Development**
- Fixed Unicode encoding issues in `custom_synth_miner.py` and `synth_integration.py`
- Corrected ensemble model prediction logic for better efficiency
- Successfully deployed miner to DigitalOcean server (167.71.143.194)
- Miner is running with UID 233 on subnet 50

### âœ… **Stake Management**
- Successfully staked 1 TAO to increase stake from ~93.64 to 94.64 Ï„
- Created comprehensive stake explanation and monitoring guide
- Documented stake growth and unstaking processes

### âœ… **Dashboard Development**
- Built Flask-based web dashboard (`miner_api.py` + `miner_dashboard.html`)
- Created real-time data fetching from server via SSH
- Implemented stake tracking, validator request monitoring, and system metrics
- Fixed multiple hardcoded values to fetch real data

### âœ… **Documentation**
- Created `miner_monitoring_commands.md` with essential SSH commands
- Documented all key terminal commands for miner monitoring
- Built comprehensive troubleshooting guide

## ðŸš§ **Current Issues**

### **Dashboard Problems**
- API calls timing out due to multiple simultaneous SSH commands
- Dashboard stuck in endless refresh loop
- Complex data fetching causing reliability issues
- Need to simplify approach with sequential SSH calls

### **Data Fetching Issues**
- SSH commands failing due to encoding/timeout issues
- Multiple concurrent API calls overwhelming the system
- Cache mechanism not working effectively

## ðŸ“‹ **Tomorrow's Priority Tasks**

### **1. Fix Dashboard (High Priority)**
- [ ] Implement sequential SSH command execution (one at a time)
- [ ] Remove auto-refresh completely - manual refresh only
- [ ] Simplify API to fetch only essential data first
- [ ] Test each SSH command individually to ensure they work
- [ ] Add proper error handling and fallbacks

### **2. Miner Health Check**
- [ ] Verify miner is still running on server
- [ ] Check if receiving any validator requests
- [ ] Confirm stake and balance are correct
- [ ] Review miner logs for any errors

### **3. Dashboard Optimization**
- [ ] Start with basic data: status, stake, balance
- [ ] Add more metrics gradually once basic data works
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add error messages when data fails to load

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Notes**

### **Current Server Status**
- **IP**: 167.71.143.194
- **Wallet**: wallet1
- **Hotkey**: default
- **UID**: 233
- **Subnet**: 50 (Synth)
- **Current Stake**: ~94.64 Ï„
- **Wallet Balance**: ~1.1976 Ï„

### **Key Files**
- `custom_synth_miner.py` - Main miner implementation
- `synth_integration.py` - Ensemble model integration
- `miner_api.py` - Complex dashboard API (needs fixing)
- `simple_miner_api.py` - Simplified API (backup)
- `miner_dashboard.html` - Dashboard frontend
- `miner_monitoring_commands.md` - SSH command reference

## ðŸ’¡ **Lessons Learned**

1. **Start Simple**: Complex dashboards with multiple concurrent SSH calls cause timeouts
2. **Sequential is Better**: Run SSH commands one at a time, not in parallel
3. **Manual Refresh**: Auto-refresh causes more problems than it solves
4. **Test Incrementally**: Test each component individually before combining

## ðŸŽ¯ **Tomorrow's Goal**

**Get a working dashboard that reliably shows:**
- Miner online/offline status
- Current stake amount
- Wallet balance
- Basic system metrics

**Then gradually add more features once the foundation works.**

---

**Status**: Dashboard needs fixing, miner is running  
**Next Session**: Focus on dashboard reliability and sequential data fetching
